# Walmart-Redesign
1. Enhanced user engagement and interaction on the Walmart application by accounting for an updated UI/UX design, as measured by the improved user experience and interface.
2. By leveraging Figma and Moqups, I implemented additional user interface designs, including animations, video content, and user onboarding, while also introducing new features and services to enhance user-friendliness
